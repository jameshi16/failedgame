# FailedGame

FailedGame, a project I worked on for 2 (manhour) weeks, but gave up on.

While you may find worthlessness in this repositories' existence, I took away some lessons that I hope can be useful to someone else in the future - these lessons are documented in [this blog post](https://codingindex.xyz/2020/10/05/failed-game/).

## Running the project

The only pre-requisite you need is [nodejs + npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Then, by running the following commands,

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

You can then navigate to https://localhost:8080, and play the game!

## Credits

I have no artistic talent, hence I was not able to create any of the resources used in the project. These are the resources I used:

- Indoor tiles: https://opengameart.org/content/oga-16x16-jrpg-sprites-tiles
- City tiles: https://opengameart.org/content/roguelike-modern-city-pack 
- City tiles extensions: https://opengameart.org/content/modern-city-extension
- Forest tiles: https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-forest-tiles
- Projectiles (arrow in this case): https://opengameart.org/content/projectiles
- LPC Spritesheet Character Generator: http://gaurav.munjal.us/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator/
